# Hackathon Project: Integrated Maintenance Solution

Welcome to our hackathon project! This repository is divided into three main branches, each focusing on a specific domain to provide a comprehensive solution for maintenance tasks in production plants. 

## Overview

Our proposed solution addresses the following areas:

1. **Kraken**: Implementing a data kraken to handle inputs from various sensors and protocols, streaming data to a central server to create a unified database.
2. **Data Stream**: Feature processing, visualization, and mathematical modeling using XML files.
3. **Unity**: Integrating 3D data with augmented reality to facilitate reactive and preventive maintenance tasks, and visualizing data flow packets between sensors for better project explanation and information flow.

## Branches

### 1. Kraken

The **Kraken** branch focuses on the implementation of a data kraken that takes inputs from different sensors and protocols. These inputs are streamed to a central server, creating a unified database.

- **Branch**: [kraken](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/kraken)
- **README**: Detailed implementation and instructions can be found in the Kraken branch's [README](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/kraken/blob/main/README.md).

### 2. Data Stream

The **Data Stream** branch includes tasks for processing, visualizing, and mathematically modeling features from XML files.

- **Branch**: [data_stream](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/data_stream)
- **README**: Detailed instructions on feature processing, visualization, and modeling can be found in the Data Stream branch's [README](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/data_stream/blob/main/README.md).

### 3. Unity

The **Unity** branch strives to integrate 3D data with augmented reality. It aims to facilitate both reactive and preventive maintenance tasks, with the added possibility of showing data flow packets between sensors.

- **Branch**: unity
- **README**: Detailed implementation and instructions can be found in the Unity branch's [README].
