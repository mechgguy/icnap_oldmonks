# Hackathon Project: Integrated Maintenance Solution

Welcome to our hackathon project! This repository is divided into three main branches, each focusing on a specific domain to provide a comprehensive solution for maintenance tasks in production plants. 

## Overview

Our proposed solution addresses the following areas:

1. **Kraken**: Implementing a data kraken to handle inputs from various sensors and protocols, streaming data to a central server to create a unified database.
2. **Data Stream**: Feature processing, visualization, and mathematical modeling using XML files.
3. **Unity**: Integrating 3D data with augmented reality to facilitate reactive and preventive maintenance tasks, and visualizing data flow packets between sensors for better project explanation and information flow.

## Branches

### 1. Kraken

The **Kraken** branch focuses on the implementation of a data kraken that takes inputs from different sensors and protocols. These inputs are streamed to a central server, creating a unified database.

- **Branch**: [kraken](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/kraken)
- **README**: Detailed implementation and instructions can be found in the Kraken branch's [README](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/kraken/blob/main/README.md).

### 2. Data Stream

The **Data Stream** branch includes tasks for processing, visualizing, and mathematically modeling features from XML files.

- **Branch**: [data_stream](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/data_stream)
- **README**: Detailed instructions on feature processing, visualization, and modeling can be found in the Data Stream branch's [README](https://github.com/icnap_oldmonks/data_stream/blob/main/README.md).

### 3. Unity

The **Unity** branch strives to integrate maintainance tasks with mixed reality. It aims to facilitate both reactive and preventive maintenance tasks and to simulate the 3D environment related to them, with the added possibility of showing data flow packets between sensors.

- **Branch**: unity
- **README**: Detailed implementation and instructions can be found in the Unity branch's [README].
